## Purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Swiggy Analysis Project

This EDA aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Swiggy dataset before delving into deeper analysis. By cleaning and exploring the data, we seek to answer key questions about restaurant characteristics, customer preferences, and potential relationships between various factors. This understanding will serve as a crucial foundation for:

**1. Unveiling Restaurant Landscape:**

* **Understanding the overall composition:** Comparing vegetarian and non-vegetarian restaurant proportions provides insights into dietary preferences within the user base.
* **Identifying performance trends:** Analyzing the distribution of restaurant ratings across different categories helps assess overall customer satisfaction and potential areas for improvement.
* **Exploring pricing strategies:** Examining the average price distribution across ranges and its potential correlation with ratings reveals pricing trends and customer sensitivity.
* **Discovering popular offerings:** Identifying the most frequent cuisines and dishes offered highlights menu preferences and potential demand patterns.

**2. Mapping Customer Preferences:**

* **Gaining insights into location choices:** Studying the geographical distribution of restaurants across India pinpoints areas with high demand and potential underserved locations.

**3. Identifying Potential Relationships:**

* **Unveiling price-rating correlation:** Assessing the relationship between average price and restaurant ratings can reveal customers' value perception and price sensitivity.

**Overall, this EDA aims to lay the groundwork for further analysis.** By uncovering trends, preferences, and potential relationships, we gain valuable insights to:

* **Develop targeted marketing strategies for restaurants.**
* **Identify areas for service improvement based on customer preferences.**
* **Predict future demand and optimize resource allocation.**
* **Formulate data-driven recommendations for both Swiggy and its partner restaurants.**

This initial exploration sets the stage for uncovering deeper insights and enabling data-driven decision-making across the Swiggy platform.
