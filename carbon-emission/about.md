**understand the relationship between carbon emissions and various lifestyle factors.** 

Here's a breakdown of the specific goals:

**1. Exploring the data:**
   * Identify numerical and categorical features.
   * Understand the distribution of carbon emissions.
   * Analyze categorical features like diet and transport method individually.

**2. Investigating relationships:**
   * Examine the connection between carbon emissions, diet, and transport method.
   * Determine if there are significant links between carbon emissions and specific numerical features like vehicle usage, grocery spending, or waste generation.
   * Identify any statistically significant relationships between numerical features and carbon emissions.

**3. Detecting anomalies:**
   * Check for outliers in carbon emissions within specific categories.

Overall, the EDA aims to **uncover patterns and associations** between individual choices and carbon footprint. This information can be valuable for raising awareness about lifestyle choices and their environmental impact, and potentially suggesting ways to reduce individual carbon emissions.
